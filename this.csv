left,"Anadol, Refik",,"Anadol is a media artist who creates immersive multimedia installations using machine learning to transform data into aesthetic experiences. His site-specific artworks visualizes large datasets as hybrid physical virtual environments. Anadol processed over 100 million images of New York City into a dreamlike abstraction. 

Anadol is a Turkish new media artist, recognized as a pioneer in the data visualisation and AI arts. His practice involves a hybrid of arts, technology, science and architecture. In his early days, he worked with pixels and 3D projections to translate sensory information into installations such as through , Visions of America: Amériques that woks with algorithmic sound analysis. He later moved on the data painting, which takes in analysis of large data sets to create a visual representation using a software he created to read, analyse and visualise. Ultimately this soon led him to explore the consciousness of AI, experimenting with machine learning to create dreamlike abstractions. Machine Hallucinations is a series of AI-generated artworks that ponders the visual form of large data sets. Machine Hallucinations: Unsupervised was also among the first AI-generated artworks to be exhibited at MoMa.

Anadol’s work showed me that tech and art can indeed exist cohesively as a unified form. AI generated art is often perceived as detrimental to traditional artists, however Anadol manages to successfully utilise its generative capabilities to merge data sets and machine learning into unique abstractions that not only demonstrates a refined aesthetic sensibility but also complete technical control over the machine.  This inspires me to explore data visualisation with a creative eye and consider deeper meanings behind the black and white numbers on a sheet. My project ideation section noted in workbook 2C (week9) experiments with concepts of data visualisation. Social Garden was my attempt in considering how I could visualise audio into a garden like abstraction within a room. Although I would not be able to create a program that interprets data to the level of Anadol, I can begin to consider simple ways the machine can dissect my dataset and generate a simple patterns from it.",https://refikanadol.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MoMA_Thumb-900x900.jpg ,,"Unsupervised - Machine Hallucinations,Refik Anadol. 2023.

left,"Chung, Sougwen",,"Sougwen Chung is an internationally renown multidisciplinary artists who engages in collaborative art-making with machines. She addresses human computer relationship through an intersection of robotics, AI, mark making and human performance. She built a robot named D.O.U.G (Drawing Operations Unit Generation) and together, they dip their brushes in paint and make marks on a large blank canvas. Chung kneels on the opposite the machine,  positions herself as though she is at eye level with the machine and she works in synergy with the robot as they fill the canvas with intentional marks. As the final painting is revealed, there isn’t a clear distinction of where the robots marks ends, and hers begin. Its ultimately the product of a conversation between of a human and robot. This approach challenges the idea of the artist as the sole creator, opening up conversations surrounding co-authorship and agency in AI-driven creativity. Chung often showcases her work through live drawing performances with her robots, reinforcing the idea that interactive media does not only have to be functional or automated, but can be intimate and expressive. 

As I watch her performance paired with an immersive audio and at times visual projections, it makes me view the robot as an equal to Chung. There wasn’t a point at which I focused more on either side, but rather kept looking at the final piece as a collaboration between two artists. I felt like it was less so humanising a robot, but rather finding a space for both human and robot to coexist artistically together on the same canvas. 

In workbook 2C experiments with Chindogu, I considered themes of cohesion together with the robots. My anti-fog glasses acts as little fingers which lets the user enjoy hot food without the fog on their glasses. The fingers wipe across the lenses when fog starts to appear. Thinking about the physical implications of it, it almost feels as though the robot is working as an extension of the human, collaborating to make the experience pleasant.",https://scorpios.com/assets/31_004b03204b032066857a72.jpg,,"The Art of Hybrid Intelligence, Sougwen Chung. 2022.",,https://sougwen.com/,"Performative art, Robots",
left,Design Intelligence Lab,,"Six-Forty by Four-Eighty by Design Intelligence Lab is a large scale lighting installation the breaks pixels away from the screen, physically immersing viewers into an interactive computing experience. The pixels group together to create patterns and animation that resembles digital graffiti. The individual screens changes colour and behaviour as a reflection to human interaction, drawing the focus to the materiality of computation and new forms for design to emerge. Its aimed to present the digital art world like a tangible object. 

What stood out to me was how similar some of the touch actions were to things we’ll typically do with our phones and tablets. Using two touch points, we can control separate parts of the screen simultaneously. Likewise, touching two pixel panels bridges the data between each other.  Swiping across the pixels creates a similar effect to when we swipe across screens on our phones to change its content. At a higher level, technology can be seen as a form of artistic design. This inspires me to consider ways to materialise such interaction. 

In workbook 2C project ideation section, I pondered using an audio controlled system to move a character around. On a higher level, this mimicked the interaction of conversation. When a user makes a phone call, audio outputs into sound, thoughts and words. Similarly, I could take that input and materialise it into a visual output that represents the spoken word.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63ab4733acaa432bf13b435e/63d5ef8d103cc0d6a9379a7a_sixforty-wall-direct.jpg,,"Six-Forty by Four-Eighty, Design Intelligence Lab.

Real time weather data from different cities is fed into the program and translated into simulation that represents it using a software built in processing. 

eCLOUD is an example of data visualisation is not only informative, its also performative. I find it ironical that weather data is represented as indoor clouds, as though its minicking the behaviour of real clouds outdoors. Onlookers glance upwards and to observe the cloud conditions to interpret the weather, mirroring how we interact with the sky in real life. This inspired me to look into interactions within the world as a source of inspiration when designing meaningful interactivity. 

In workbook 2A, I used a farm as my main source of inspiration. The weekly content was attached to free roaming animals across the screen. In order to view the content, the viewer had to “catch” the animal. The content will not be viewable if the viewer does not catch the corresponding animal within its target zone. This mimics a hunt. Viewers sit behind their screens waiting for the animal to appear, and then at the right time they make a hunt in order to get what they want.",https://live.staticflickr.com/2690/4444946248_e0c960f78e_b.jpg,,eCLOUD.

left,"LeWitt, Sol",,"Sol Lewitt is an American artist recognised for his contributions in minimal and conceptual art. Although not explicit, I see a parallel between Lewitt’s conceptual art practice with AI art generators. His wall drawing pieces in particular reminds me of that. In order to showcase his works, a gallery follows the rules Lewitt has set, and reinterprets the artwork. His prompts provide constraints and rules, similar to data training and algorithms that guides AI. Amy Goodchild, an artist and creative technologist did an experiment by feeding ChatGPT 3 and 4 LeWitt’s prompts. ChatGPT 4 recreated the artworks closely similar to how LeWitt’s intended outcome should look like.  However the unpredictable nature of ChatGPT 3 created variations in the design, it reflects a similar novelty of conceptual pieces created by varied human interpretation. This experiment using AI can be seen as fulfilling LeWitt’s vision of prompt-based creation. 

In my workbook 2C, the idealised outcome for it was to add simple instructions on the main landing page for the user to move the character and explore the scene. Although it did not managed to be fulfilled due to technical incapabilities, I was inspired by LeWitt’s constraints, and leaving the audience to explore and find out new interactions hidden within the scene.",https://cdn.magasin3.com/uploads/2014/08/multimedia-17060-img-1.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f33cddd6aff255aabb0c6cd/c64747c7-1818-47e2-a324-3eab1f6ea72b/gpt4-walldrawing-118.png?format=1500w,Wall Drawing #118.

left,"Rahal, Sahej ",,"Sahej Rahal is a Mumbai-based artist known for his sculptural hybrids that are mythological, imaginary and futuristic. His work Bashinda, was commisioned for the biennale. It is an AI-simulated world filled with creatures that are driven by multiple AI behavioural scripts that directs their movement. The combination of all of these different scripts attached onto one body results in utter chaos as its almost like creature being driven by multiple minds. When a group of different creatures with unique sets of AI scripts encoded into them encounter, it creates unpredictable situations. Sometimes the machines start pushing and fighting, and other times it entangles with each other and starts dancing. 

Rahel admits that he never set out thinking about what he was creating at first, but rather leaves it all up to experimentation and making sense of the end product upon its completion. Rahal’s approach is unlike others. Through my own exploration in thinking about the ways I can utilise AI in my work, I find myself referencing Rahel’s approach. In my workbook 2B, I tried incorporating 3D into my design. At first I tried reading the documentation, and started experimenting with values and code snippets I found online, however most of the times the result was not what I expected. I then started working with AI to learn better code manipulation. The result was a blend between both documentation experimentation and AI generated art direction. Although it wasn’t what I intended from the start, I found pockets of meaning within its design, and celebrated the collaboration of art between AI and myself.",https://static.frieze.com/files/inline-images/Sahej-Rahal-video-still.jpg,,Bashinda.

left,Resn's Little Helper,,"Resyn’s Little Helper is a atypical Christmas website. The viewer is greeted by an instrumental version of “Last Christmas” playing softly in the background. The narrator invites you to join an elf inside the cabin by holding down your mouse. Upon holding down and entering the cabin, the elf presents itself in trippy almost creepy visuals. Both the viewer and the elf, alongside other objects are levitating in a pink vortex that feels disorientating. I felt really uncomfortable inside the cabin, but for some odd reason, I couldnt escape it, and always ended up going back in. As a whole, this interactive media felt contradicting to other types of artwork. Generally, most artist does their best to create a space for the viewer to linger. This however, does the complete opposite, yet it undeniably drew me towards it.  

This feeling of an almost indescribable tension and suffocation was one of the themes I wanted to explore for my final project ideas from workbook 2C. The Escape Room took inspiration from this sensory experience of Resn’s Little Helper. I wanted to explore ways to draw thrill out of a undesirable emotion such as fear and tension. For example, the space navigates a similar 3D scene set up as the cabin from Resn’s Little Helper while playing around with strategic positioning of objects to make it look like its levitating and surrounding the player. Using this website as a guide, I was inspired to explore negative emotions and challenge myself to create an engaging experience out of it.",https://assets.awwwards.com/awards/external/2017/12/5a33bf89c40fe_static.jpeg,,Resyn’s Little Helper website,,http://littlehelper.resn.global/,"Website, Interactive Media",

Her works bridges kinetic art, drawing, video, installation, painting, performance and sculpture One of her works, ADA: Interactive Kinetic-Sculpture is a kinetic sculpture inspired by Ada Lovelace, who is largely recognised as the first computer programmers. In the sculpture, ADA takes on the form of a transparent membrane with charcoal spikes and reacts to kinetic energy from its visitors. ADA revolves around the room, leaving charcoal marks and slowly building into patterns and signs. ADA became a landmark in kinetic and interactive installation in art, inspiring the ways artists can explore how audience can shape artwork itself through direct physical interaction.

Her work invites the audience to be an active participant rather than passive observer. The installation is not complete without the active participation of the viewer. This shapes my ways of thinking about interactive media. My p5 experiments in workbook 2B invites the viewer to interact with the canvas to see the effects of their interaction. For example, moving a cursor around populates the screen with different graphics, or sitting still allows a complete pixel painting of themselves. The p5 experimentations cannot simply exist on its own without the viewer’s interaction.

left,"Tresset, Patrick",,"Patrick Tresset is a contemporary French artist based in Brussels. He is best known for his performative installations through the representation of human presence and experience using computational systems, AI, robotics and traditional media. But Tresset’s artistic journey didn’t quite begin like this. His  early education started with business computing, before he decided to pursue a career as a painter. However, in his thirteenth year as a painter he experienced a creative block. Feeling like his own paintings  started to look stiff and unemotional, he turned back to programming. There he started exploring creative programming, merging his painting expertise with systematic programming.  He created simulated drawings on pen plotters and programs he wrote himself. He understood that a gestural drawing system needed to be embodied, so he simulated different processes that interact with parts dedicated to low level perception, then higher motor control and strategy. The style of the drawing is a consequence of the characteristics of the robot. 

Tresset’s engagement with both computing and painting resonates with my engagement with 3D and coding. Coming from a previous background in VFX, I often wonder if 3D could exist in spaces beyond the film and game industry. After getting to learn some simple webGL, I realised there is endless possibility to use 3D to tell stories in a web design space. In workbook 2B I experimented with merging the two concepts together, but its only in workbook 2C that I managed to consider injecting storytelling concepts into the design. My workbook 2C takes the user on a memory lane down my experience in this Interactive Media course and recount key moments within this semester.",https://live.staticflickr.com/3917/14827797521_8241cd98f3_b.jpg,,"Six Robots Named Paul, Patrick Tresset. 2012.
